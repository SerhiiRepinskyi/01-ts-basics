## ✨ What This Project Covers

The project consists of **8 independent TypeScript tasks**, each implemented in a separate file.  
The goal is to practice clean, explicit, and safe typing in TypeScript.

Covered topics include:

- Explicit typing of primitive values
- Interfaces and optional / readonly properties
- Array typing
- Function parameter and return types
- Union types
- Generics
- Promise typing
- Typing HTTP requests with Axios

- Each task is isolated in its own file.
- No task depends on another.
- Code is formatted with **Prettier**.
- Types are explicit and readable.

## 🧪 Tasks Overview

### Task 1 – Scalar Types

Explicit typing of string, number, and boolean variables.

### Task 2 – Interfaces

Creating and using interfaces with `readonly` and optional properties.

### Task 3 – Arrays

Typing arrays of primitives and objects.

### Task 4 – Functions

Typing function parameters and return types, including optional parameters.

### Task 5 – Union Types

Restricting function input to a fixed set of string literals.

### Task 6 – Generics

Creating a generic function that works with different data types.

### Task 7 – Promises

Typing a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.

### Task 8 – HTTP Requests

Typing Axios GET requests and API responses using interfaces.
